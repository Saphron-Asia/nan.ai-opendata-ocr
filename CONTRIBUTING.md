## Reporting an issue

We use GitHub Issue Tracking [`here`](https://github.com/Saphron-Asia/nanai-opendata-ocr/issues) to track issues. This is a good place to start and can be a helpful place to manage both technical and non-technical issues.


## New sources

* Have a potential source? Fantastic! Follow these steps to help us get it into the project as fast as possible!    
  - Check the wiki [link to a wiki page containing collated data sources; see sample on comment] to make sure it isn't listed there.

* Still a new source? Awesome!  
  - If the source costs money, please add it to the Commercial Wiki [insert link]
  - If you have an awesome link/contact but no data, add it to the Outreach Wiki [insert link]
  - Finally if you have raw data, open an issue [issue page] and we'll add it for you or add it yourself.


## Adding data sources (AWS S3)

**Note:** The credentials provided here are shared across all data contributors. Hence, the permissions granted to it are limited. The key-pair provided can only access the dedicated open data bucket `saphron-opendata-submissions` and **upload** objects there. Make sure that the data to be uploaded is the correct version/copy because only the **Project Maintainers** are capable of deleting S3 files/ojbects. 

1. Install MinIO client to access S3 (AWS Simple Storage Service) by following the steps indicated [here](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-complete-guide).
2. Set your connection to AWS S3 by running: 
  ```
  mc alias set <alias-for-opendata> https://s3.amazonaws.com AKIA6KOZY3ODHZ3MPK5H PQB85WBcrdFPNI3SD6RRPluNT8S0Xgyq+9dBKoCY --api S3v4
  i.e.
  mc alias set unicef-opendata https://s3.amazonaws.com AKIA6KOZY3ODHZ3MPK5H PQB85WBcrdFPNI3SD6RRPluNT8S0Xgyq+9dBKoCY --api S3v4
  ```
3. Verify that you are connected:
  ```
  mc ls <alias-for-opendata>
  i.e. 
  mc ls unicef-opendata
  ```
  You should see something similar to this: 
  ```
  [2021-04-14 14:48:36]    0B raw-data-ocr-chatbot/
  [2021-04-14 14:48:19]    0B raw-data-ocr/
  [2021-04-16 11:38:37]    0B saphron-opendata-submissions/
  ```
4. Upload your data to the `saphron-opendata-submissions` bucket:
  ```
  mc cp <your-file> <alias-for-opendata>/saphron-opendata-submissions
  ```
5. Confirm that your file has been uploaded to the S3 bucket successfully:
  ```
  mc ls <alias-for-opendata>/saphron-opendata-submissions
  ```
  And check if your file is in the returned objects list.
