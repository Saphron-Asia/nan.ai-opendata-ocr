## Reporting an issue

We use GitHub Issue Tracking [`here`](https://github.com/Saphron-Asia/nanai-opendata-ocr/issues) to track issues. This is a good place to start and can be a helpful place to manage both technical and non-technical issues.


## New sources

* Have a potential source? Fantastic! Follow these steps to help us get it into the project as fast as possible!    
  - Check the wiki [link to a wiki page containing collated data sources; see sample on comment] to make sure it isn't listed there.

* Still a new source? Awesome!  
  - If the source costs money, please add it to the Commercial Wiki [insert link]
  - If you have an awesome link/contact but no data, add it to the Outreach Wiki [insert link]
  - Finally if you have raw data, open an issue [issue page] and we'll add it for you or add it yourself.
